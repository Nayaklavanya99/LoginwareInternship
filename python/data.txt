So what is life yoou ask?
you immbecile life inst something thats worth a penny, life , in its eniterity isnt worth anything, its just whos life it is
sometimes You falter in life, that doesnt mean the end of it.
dont try to define your life, dont try anything
do it, trying is for loosers and you aren't one are you?
i commend you that you have made this far , but if this is your limit
then be it, go live as you like, live big, if you desire no further success then be it
but remeber i wont be waiting for you forever, the destiny desires what it cannnot desire
if desire is something you possses, you posses nothing but misfortune.
Il take my live, live long, live big.
